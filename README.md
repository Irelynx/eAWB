Enhanced, because you can specify the amount you wish to clip.  

somewhere around 5 seems to be a good amount,  
but you can set it higher or lower,  
if you prefer more, or less, filtering.

*Some images may need more aggressive filtering than others.*  

*If the color appears off:* 
Undo, then try *Highlight Clip 10* , and/or uncheck *Soft tint*.   

Eyes are more sensitive to light regions than shadows, so  
I would venture a guess highlights may need tweaking to get good results.  
You decide the direction you wanna take it.  

When you open your histogram and look at where the ranges are,  
you may notice an image has highlights, but no shadows.  

In this case, you can specify that you prefer clipping more from the shadows,  
and leave the highlights alone.  Or vice-versa.  Your choice, it's enhanced.  

This will, of course, depend upon your camera, and the lighting,  
So you may have better results with some pix than others.  

It might not cure images that have color bleeding in from another light source.  
Can't promise any miricles with this plugin, but it may help.  
I've had good results with the test images I've thrown at it.  
YMMV, but lemme know if you like it.  You can find me on Twitter @Doyousketch2.  

It's possible to crank it all the way up to 50 if you like,  
which will boost the contrast, but discard pixels  
that may have otherwise contributed to the dynamic range.  

If you wanna do that, I'd suggest sliding shadows up to 50  
and leaving the highlights at 7 or so.  This gives a bold look,  
but keeps enough detail in the scene to be pleasing to the eye.  

Turning off the blown highlight and burnt shadow protection is allowed.  
The results are more drastic, and if that's what you're going for,  
by all means, try it.  But for everyday use, I'd recommend you keep it on.  

You can also call eawb.py from another script,  
which is a huge advantage over the awb that was built in.  

from a Python plug-in, *aka* **python-fu**:  
`pdb.python_fu_awb(1, image, layer, hi, blow, lo, burn, soft)`  

from a Scheme script, *aka* **script-fu**:  
`(python-fu-awb 1 image layer hi blow lo burn soft)`

Place script in directory that suits your OS:

    /home/yourname/.gimp-2.8/plug-ins  
  	/usr/share/gimp/2.0/plug-ins  
    ~/Library/Application/Support/GIMP/2.8/plug-ins  

  	C:\Users\yourname\.gimp-2.8\plug-ins  
  	C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\share\gimp\2.0\plug-ins  
  	C:\Documents and Settings\yourname\.gimp-2.8\plug-ins  

If needed, *set file permissions to allow script execution:*  
    `chmod +x awb.py`  

If you have any previous versions of this script, awb.py  
discard it, and replace with this updated eawb.py

I was asking about this in r/Gimp  
https://www.reddit.com/r/GIMP/comments/7qw7eb/how_do_you_call_automatic_white_balance_from_a/  
and was informed someone else was, nearly simultaneously, asking about it on StackOverflow  
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48268068/how-do-i-do-the-equivalent-of-gimps-colors-auto-white-balance-in-python-fu  

Fortuitous event, for it led to a suitable answer.
